# Notes.

A data structure is a specialized format for organizing and storing data.
Reasons for data structures.
- Ease of Access
- Efficiency in terms of time and space when it comes to storing information.
Examples are : 
1. Heaps: a heap is a specialized tree-based data structure that satisfies the heap property: if P is a parent node of C, then the key (the value) of P is either greater than or equal to (max heap) or less than or equal to (min heap) the key of C. Used in applications where you need quick access to the largest or smallest item in a problem set.
2. A graph is a pictorial representation of a set of objects where some pairs of objects are connected by links. The interconnected objects are represented by points termed as vertices, and the links that connect the vertices are called edges. 
    1. Computer Networks
    2. Pathing and Maps
    3. Constraints and solutions
3. Tree - Hierarchical data structure which simulates a root value and subareas of children with a parent node represented by a set of linked nodes.
4. Arrays
5. Objects
6. Maps
